# GetWords
GetWords is a full-stack mobile application designed to display random words. The app is built using NestJS for the back-end and React Native for the front-end. The main goal of this project is to learn and apply modern technologies such as NestJS, React Native, RESTful APIs, AWS deployment (EC2, Lambda, RDS), and relational databases.
